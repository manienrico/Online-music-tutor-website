# Online music tutor website
 A simple website for teaching music online


In this project, i was having a test of my front end skills with the use of react.js, css, and, how to make a website mobile responsive. I successfully tested my skills of mobile responsiveness, react file and folder structure, and the use of css. Even though my css designing is still lacking. Therefore, i consider this as progress.
